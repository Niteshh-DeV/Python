## Variables and Operators

This section covers basic data types and operators in Python. You'll find examples using:
- Variables
- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Assignment and identity operators

## Strings

In this section, you'll learn how to work with strings in Python. Topics covered include:
- String concatenation
- String methods (e.g., `.split()`, `.join()`)
- String formatting

## Lists and Tuples

This section introduces **Lists** and **Tuples**, two of the most commonly used data structures in Python. Programs here demonstrate:
- List operations (add, remove, sort)
- Tuple operations (immutable sequences)
- Indexing and slicing

## Dictionaries and Sets

Learn about **Dictionaries** and **Sets** in this section:
- Dictionary key-value pairs
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Methods to manipulate dictionaries and sets

## Functions and Recursion

This section explains functions and recursion in Python:
- Defining and calling functions
- Function arguments and return values
- Recursive function examples

## File Handling in Python

Here, you will learn how to work with files in Python:
- Reading and writing to files
- Using file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.)
- File operations like opening, closing, and modifying

## OOP in Python

This section demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Operator overloading

## Practice Sets

A collection of practice problems to test your knowledge of Python:
- Challenges on basic syntax, loops, and functions
- Data structure problems using lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Advanced exercises on file handling and OOP

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a learning resource for Python enthusiasts. From beginners learning the basics to intermediate programmers exploring OOP concepts, you'll find examples and challenges to help you grow as a Python developer.
